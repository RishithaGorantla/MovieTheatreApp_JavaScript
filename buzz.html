      <h3>1.Veteran actor in Prabhas’ Salaar:</h3><br>

      <p>
        Young Rebelstar Prabhas resumed the shoot of Salaar and the shoot is
        happening in Hyderabad. Prabhas and Shruti Haasan are shooting for some
        romantic episodes in this high voltage action entertainer that is
        directed by Prashanth Neel. The film will have a bunch of renowned
        actors in crucial roles in Salaar. The latest news is that veteran actor
        Jagapathi Babu is roped in for a crucial role in Salaar.<br />

        Jagapathi Babu gave his nod some time ago and the actor joined the sets
        of Salaar recently. Salaar is carrying terrific expectations and the
        look of Prabhas already generated positive buzz. The film is announced
        for release in summer 2022 in all the Indian languages. The entire
        technical team of KGF is working for Salaar and Hombale Films are the
        producers. Prabhas is done with the shoot of Radhe Shyam and the actor
        is juggling between Salaar and Adipurush for now.

      <h3>2.Two more young actors in Prabhas’ Project K?</h3><br>

      <p>
        Young Rebelstar Prabhas and national award-winning director Nag Ashwin
        are teaming up for a big-budget film which is tentatively titled Project
        K. The shoot of the film commenced recently and the movie is aimed for a
        2023 release. Amitabh Bachchan essays a prominent role in this film and
        Deepika Padukone will romance Prabhas in this untitled pan-Indian
        project. Going with the latest update, the film will have two young
        actors playing crisp roles in the film and they will have their scenes
        with Amitabh Bachchan alone. <br />

        Considering the pan-Indian release, Nag Ashwin may consider Bollywood
        actors for the short roles. If in Tollywood, Nag Ashwin may go ahead
        with Nani and Vijay Devarakonda with whom he worked in the past. The
        film is planned on a budget of Rs 400 crores. Prabhas will join the sets
        of Project K once he is done with the shoots of Salaar and Adipurush.

        3.Following Jungle Cruise, Emily Blunt Is Heading To Amazon For New
        Movie
      </h3><br>

      <p>
        Emily Blunt can currently be seen floating down the Amazon River with
        Dwayne Johnson in Disney's Jungle Cruise movie, and it seems the actress
        had so much fun that she's decided to do it again, sort of. Blunt has
        reportedly signed on to a new movie that will see her play the first
        woman to ever join the Pinkerton Detective Agency. The movie won't
        co-star The Rock but his Seven Bucks Productions will produce the movie,
        and the story won't take place on the Amazon, but the movie will be seen
        on Amazon <br />

        The movie is being called an action adventure story, and so in that
        regard will also have something in common with Jungle Cruise, but as
        Kate Warne's detective career was during the 1850s and 1860s in America,
        the setting will be quite different. Warne investigated early
        assassination attempts against Abraham Lincoln, worked as a Union
        intelligence officer during the Civil War, and handled numerous other
        well known cases, any or all of which could be the basis for the new
        film.

        4.Latest Avatar Sequel Update Makes The James Cameron Movies Feel So
        Real
      </h3><br>

      <p>
        Avatar is, once again, the highest grossing movie of all-time. The
        sequels to the movie have been highly anticipated, and expected for over
        a decade. For all that time James Cameron had promised fans that we
        would get more Avatar. And yet, the writing of the projects took so long
        that a lot of people likely assumed they would never happen. Two more
        movies eventually became four more movies, they continued to move
        forward, and then production on the next two films actually got
        underway. Now Avatar villain Stephen Lang who we understand will be a
        big part of all the movies, has actually finished filming the next two
        films.

        <br />

        If there's anything that makes the Avatar sequels feel like they might
        actually happen, it's the words of Stephen Lang, who played Colonel
        Quaritch in the original film. He'll somehow be returning to the
        franchise despite the fact that his character did not survive the movie.
        Lang tells EW that, while the possibility of him needing to return to
        pick some small details exists, he has otherwise completed the next two
        Avatar films. The actor says... <br /><br>

        <strong
          >"I was in communication just last week with New Zealand, with my
          director, and everything's great — he's working hard. My acting work
          on both Avatar 2 and 3 is complete. I might have to go back and do a
          line here and there, but I'm really done."

        5.Justice League Producer Offers Possible Hope For Fans Hoping For A
        Sequel
      </h3><br>

      <p>
        While comic book movies have been dominating the industry for a decade,
        none have had as wild a ride as Zack Snyder’s Justice League. After a
        disappointing theatrical cut, fans campaigned for years for Warner Bros.
        to reveal the filmmaker’s true vision. And now one producer has offered
        some possible hope for fans still hoping for a sequel.

        <br />

        Zack Snyder was crafting a five-film narrative for the DCEU, starting
        with Man of Steel. As such, he was originally hoping to have two sequels
        following Justice League. And once the Snyder Cut planted some narrative
        seeds, fans are hoping Warner Bros. will change its tune and eventually
        order a sequel. Longtime DC producer Charles Roven recently spoke about
        his future in the comic book genre, including a hopeful message about
        Justice League’s possible sequel. While also speaking about James Gunn’s
        The Suicide Squad, Roven said: <br /><br>

        <strong
          >"I hope James will, when he’s got some time, come back and see if he’s
          going to do another one of these, because he did such an amazing job.
          I would definitely be a part of that. Probably another Justice League,
          although I think that’s a number of years away."
